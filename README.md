## Hi! :)

My name is Mary Grace Albright ("Mary Grace" or "MG"), and I am a 4th year PhD candidate in the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut! I am part of the [Computational Climate Change (C3) Lab](https://climatechangelab.earthsciences.uconn.edu/), which is co-directed by Dr. Ran Feng and Dr. Clay Tabor.

My research is primarily centered around paleoclimate, high resolution modeling, mesoscale convective systems (and how to track them), and equilibrium climate sensitivity. 

If you are interested in any of my work, you can contact me at marygrace.albright@uconn.edu
