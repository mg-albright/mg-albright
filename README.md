## Hi! :)

ðŸ¤  My name is Mary Grace Albright ("Mary Grace" or "MG"), and I am a 4th year PhD candidate in the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut! I am part of the [Computational Climate Change (C3) Lab](https://climatechangelab.earthsciences.uconn.edu/), which is co-directed by Dr. Ran Feng and Dr. Clay Tabor.

My research is primarily centered around paleoclimate, high resolution modeling, mesoscale convective systems + how to track them, and equilibrium climate sensitivity. 

If you are interested in any of my work, you can contact me at marygrace.albright@uconn.edu

âœ¨ I'm currently working on adapting the deep learning model used for tracking mesoscale convective systems (detailed [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13248327); repository [here](https://github.com/mariajmolina/ML-extremes-mcs/)) to be trained with global data so it can be applied to high-resolution paleoclimate simulations. This effort is part of the larger [PaleoWeather project](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/paleo/simulations/asd-paleoweather) â›ˆ
